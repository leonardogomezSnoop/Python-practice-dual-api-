# Python Practice Dual API

This is an example of how two APIs can work together. The first API (testApi) demonstrates CRUD operations using FastAPI and SQLite3. The second API is responsible for saving errors generated by testApi, and it has its own database.

## How to Install

1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv myenv`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `myenv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install all dependencies and run the application: `uvicorn test2:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001` (Note: testApiError must run on port 8001)
